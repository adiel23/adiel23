## Hi There 👋.

My name is Arthur and I am a salvadorean passionate for web development. I currently work with html, css, javaScript, Nodejs and Mysql for developing full stack web applications.

## ✏️ About My Projects 

### 🏫 Behavior tracking system:

This is a project I created for my highschool that helps teachers and school administration to register and consult information about student's violation of personal presentation standards. You can see the project in more detail here: https://github.com/adiel23/Cumple

### 📝 Blog.

This is a simple but functional blog web application. You can create your account and start posting. You can also see other people's posts and interact with them by commenting and liking them. You can also follow the author to be notified of new posts. You can see the project in more detail here: https://github.com/adiel23/node-js-blog-proyect

## 🧠 Currently Learning

I am currently learning about Bitcoin because it's an interesting technology for me and I want to be able to help more people with my projects.
